abstract: Few-shot intent detection is a practical challenge task, because new
  intents are frequently emerging and collecting large-scale data for them could
  be costly. Meta-learning, a promising technique for leveraging data from
  previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks, has been a popular
  way to tackle this problem. However, the existing meta-learning models have
  been evidenced to be overfitting when the meta-training tasks are
  insufficient. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel self-supervised
  task augmentation with meta-learning framework, namely STAM. Firstly, we
  introduce the task augmentation, which explores two different strategies and
  combines them to extend meta-training tasks. Secondly, we devise two auxiliary
  losses for integrating self-supervised learning into meta-learning to learn
  more generalizable and transferable features. Experimental results show that
  STAM can achieve consistent and considerable performance improvement to
  existing state-of-the-art methods on four datasets.
