Hi! I’m Song Dingjie, a second-year graduate student in the [Software Institute](https://software.nju.edu.cn/ "NJU SE") and the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/ "NJU NLP") at Nanjing University, advised by Dr. [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm) and Dr. [Jidong Ge](https://gjdnju.github.io/). I received my B.E. from the [Software Institute](https://software.nju.edu.cn/ "NJU SE") at Nanjing University.

My primary research interests lie in natural language processing and deep learning. My long-term goal in the research is to build an intelligent system that can understand users’ needs and solve real-world problems. I commenced a deep dive into low-resource learning and dialogue systems toward this goal. More specifically, I was interested in building a conversational agent that can be rapidly deployed in low-resource scenarios (e.g., a new business domain). My current research focuses on building models for generalization and extrapolation to new tasks/domains, involving studies in zero-shot and few-shot learning.
